# FarmLink

**FarmLink** is a decentralized agricultural marketplace that connects smallholder farmers directly with buyers using blockchain technology. Built on **Somnia Network**, it leverages fast, low-cost, and high-throughput infrastructure to power real-world supply chains.

## 🌾 What We’re Building

FarmLink enables:
- On-chain product listings (produce, livestock, grains)
- Smart contract-based order & payment processing
- Token-based transactions (using Somnia’s STT)
- Product traceability with QR-code integration

## 🚜 Real-World Impact

FarmLink addresses inefficiencies in agricultural trade, removes intermediaries, and ensures that farmers receive fairer prices. It's designed for rural inclusion, local food trade, and supply chain transparency.

## 🔧 Tech Stack (Planned)
- Solidity for smart contracts
- React or simple HTML/CSS for the frontend
- Somnia Testnet for deployment
- IPFS or cloud storage for product data (future)

## 📍 Status
Early development stage — MVP and smart contracts in progress. Built by a solo founder entering Web3 with practical goals.
